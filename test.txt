Notes:
    - First, I need to analyze how big this gets -- AKA, how many times each are added to a node of k vs. a node of c
    - ...Second, if my hunch is right, I can recursively screen out the lowest integers from the bottom up by
            proportionalizing out worst-case scenarios for a given k by their # of neighbors
    - Third, I need to think up and implement an actual symmetricizing algorithm...
    - Fourth: consider, too, what if the k clique has many members each, that each take away from itself when proportionalizing?
            (as well, the difficulty of singling out a single node rather than an entire clique's members as a whole)
    - Fifth: It's also worthwhile looking into optimizations of my approach, if it works -- if the maximum number of edges any node has
            is some number significantly less than n, say 39 vs. 4000, then looking at subgraphs of nodes' neighbors and doing the algorithm would be worthwhile --> 4000*39^11 = 10^21 vs. 4000^11 = 10^39

    - # Intersections in graph of n-clique = Summation from 1 to n-4 of T(n) (tetrahedral number) = C(n,4)
    - If this indeed does work... wow, what a chimera of approaches. -->
            Proportionality of symmetrical, non-existent abstract edge intersections in circular relative ordering, while playing a numbers game comparing between integers... between successive reductionist rounds on the graph.

Other Approaches to Try:
    - Analyze growth
    - Analyze a node's composition of cliques
    - Analyze ratio of edge to intersections
    - 3-box shuffling
    - Look at degree of connection consumptions
    - 2 k-2 vs. 1 k
