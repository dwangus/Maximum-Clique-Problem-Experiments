#Max Clique Problem Experiments

Just an incoherent mess of notes/equations/Python-scripts used to test several theoretical and heuristic approaches to approximating and/or solving the NP-Hard Max-Clique/Max-Independent-Set Problem.

Will eventually write a summary of results into an LateX paper and post on arXiv.

All heuristics tested on benchmark challenge graphs by DIMACS, posted here: http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~fmascia/maximum_clique/DIMACS-benchmark
